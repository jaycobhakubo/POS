  After one minute of inactivity, the kiosk will search for the highest letter drive with a 
GameTech\Attract\Kiosk Videos or GameTech\Attract\Kiosk Closed Videos folder and play any videos there in alphabetical order in a loop
until the screen is touched or a card is swiped.  If a video is interrupted by use of the kiosk,
the videos will resume starting with the video that was interrupted.
